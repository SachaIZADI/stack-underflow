# Define a stopwords dictionnary :

stopwords = nltk.corpus.stopwords.words('english')

# We keep the negative adverbs
stopwords.remove('no')
stopwords.remove('not')

# We remove the iphone and galaxy vocabulary
stopwords.append('iphone')
stopwords.append('apple')
stopwords.append('samsung')
stopwords.append('galaxy')
stopwords.append('s8')

print(stopwords)


 We want to keep the negative indicators (e.g. wouldn't --> keep not).
# So we need to expand common English contractions
# To do so, we use a bit of code from StackOverFlow



# this code is not mine! i shamelessly copied it from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19790188/expanding-english-language-contractions-in-python
# all credits go to alko and arturomp @ stack overflow.
# basically, it's a big find/replace.
